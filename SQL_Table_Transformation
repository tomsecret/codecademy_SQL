# Summary
The UNION clause allows us to utilize information from multiple tables in our queries.
The UNION ALL clause allows us to utilize information from multiple tables in our queries, including duplicate values.
INTERSECT is used to combine two SELECT statements, but returns rows only from the first SELECT statement that are identical to a row in the second SELECT statement.
EXCEPT returns distinct rows from the first SELECT statement that arenâ€™t output by the second SELECT statement
